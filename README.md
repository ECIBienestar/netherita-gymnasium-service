# ECIBienestarGymService

Gym management microservice for the ECIBienestar platform. She manages Gym Sessions, Reservations, Physical Routines, Physical Progress and Trainer Reports for wellness services at the Julio Garavito Colombian School of Engineering.

## Overview

This module allows students to book training sessions, design their personalized routines, and track their physical progress in detail.

With the accompaniment of a coach, users receive feedback on their progress, get recommendations tailored to their goals, and access sessions structured according to their needs.

In addition, coaches can generate individual and group performance reports, as well as reports on sessions, manage routines, and optimize the training experience.

## Interaction with other modules

The module operates as an independent microservice, orchestrated within a microservices-based architecture and exposed through an API Gateway that manages authentication and request routing.

General Interaction Flow:

    -Client (Web/Mobile): Sends requests for medical shifts to the API Gateway.

API Gateway:

    -Obtains a JWT token from the Auth Service.

    -Validates the token and routes the request to the corresponding microservice.

Medical Shifts Service:

    -Verifies the user and their roles through the Users Service.

    -Processes the request, records the information in its database, and emits events to the Event Bus.

Statistics Service:

    -Consumes generated events to generate historical reports and care statistics.

### Components

This diagram illustrates the architectural model of the module, showing how different components interact. It includes services, controllers, repositories, and external dependencies, providing a clear view of the systemâ€™s modular design. It also depicts security using JWT, user roles (Administrative and Student), and tools for testing and code coverage (Mockito, JUnit 5, JaCoCo). The system is deployed to the cloud, and data is stored in MongoDB.
